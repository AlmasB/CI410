#### Structure

- Roughly 50%-50% lecture + tutorial per week
- Roughly (50%-50%) fundamental Game Dev theory / Unity
- Lecture: theory, game design
- Tutorial: practice, implementation

---

#### Importance of Theory

- You **will** need a good grasp of theory for your courses (DGD, CSG)
- Frameworks / engines are just a tool for implementing theory

---

#### Game Architecture Theory

- Init
- Main Loop (Input, Update, Render)
- Cleanup

---

#### Game Architecture Implementation (Unity)

- OnEnable()
- Update()
- OnDisable()

---

#### Approach to Learning Theory

- We want quick results - no time to cover _all_ of game dev
- Pragmatic Approach - omit irrelevant stuff until needed

---

#### Unity

- Similar pragmatic approach focused on minimal required concepts
- Language is C#, somewhat similar to Java
- Quick Demo

---

#### Assessment

- Implement a Unity game prototype (100%)
- Demo
- Good time to ask questions

---

#### Conclusion

- A lot of theory
- Unity / C#
- Stepping stone for future modules
- Challenging but fun
